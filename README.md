# WolfVue: Wildlife Video Classifier

A tool for automatically classifying trail camera videos using YOLO object detection, originally developed for The Gray Wolf Research Project.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

Note: this script has only been tested on windows 11 and may not operate on Mac/Linux correctly.

# WolfVue: Wildlife Video Classifier

A tool for automatically classifying trail camera videos using YOLO object detection, originally developed for The Gray Wolf Research Project.

## Download & Setup

**Step 1: Download WolfVue**
1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of this GitHub page
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop or Documents folder
4. Open the extracted folder - it should contain `wolfvue.py`, `best.pt`, and folders named `input_videos/` and `output_videos/`

**Step 2: Install Python**
1. Download Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. During installation, CHECK "Add Python to PATH" (important!)
3. Restart your computer

**Step 3: Install Required Packages**
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
2. Navigate to your WolfVue folder:
   ```
   cd Desktop/WolfVue
   ```
3. Install packages:
   ```
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python pyyaml tqdm colorama
   ```

## Using WolfVue

**Step 4: Add Your Videos**
- Copy your trail camera videos into the `input_videos/` folder
- Supported formats: .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv

**Step 5: Run the Script**
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to your WolfVue folder
2. Run:
   ```
   python wolfvue.py
   ```
   if this doesnt work, try clicking on the WolfVue folder, and then click "copy filepath". Then modify the original prompt.

  Example:
  ```
  python "C:\Users\Coastal_wolf\Desktop\WolfVue\WolfVue.py"
  ```

3. Press Enter for each prompt (unless you want to change file paths)
4. Wait for processing to complete - you'll see lots of scrolling text showing frame detection

**Step 6: Check Results**
Find your sorted videos in:
- `output_videos/Sorted/` - organized by species
- `output_videos/Unsorted/` - mixed species or unclear
- `output_videos/No_Animal/` - no animals detected
- `processing_report.txt` - detailed classification report

## Troubleshooting

**"Python is not recognized"**
- Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
- Restart your computer

**"No module named 'ultralytics'"**
- Make sure you ran the pip install command in the correct WolfVue folder

**"No videos found"**
- Check that videos are in the `input_videos/` folder with supported file extensions

**Script crashes**
- Ensure `best.pt` and `WlfCamData.yaml` are in your WolfVue folder

## Tips
- Test with 1-2 videos first
- Processing time varies by computer speed and video length
- Check the processing report for detailed explanations

## How It Works

WolfVue processes trail camera footage frame by frame, detecting animals using a trained YOLO model. It then analyzes the temporal patterns of detections to classify each video into one of three categories:

- **Species folders**: Videos with a clear dominant species (>70% of detections)
- **Unsorted**: Videos with multiple species, predator-prey conflicts, or unclear patterns to be manually sorted
- **No_Animal**: Videos with zero animal detections

## Configuration

The main parameters you can adjust in the script:

```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.25          # Minimum YOLO confidence score
DOMINANT_SPECIES_THRESHOLD = 0.7     # Required percentage for dominant species
MAX_SPECIES_TRANSITIONS = 5          # Maximum allowed species changes
CONSECUTIVE_EMPTY_FRAMES = 30        # Empty frames to break a detection sequence
```
NOTE: this only adjusts the sorting algoritm based on frame detection BY the yolo model, but does not effect the YOLO model itself.
## Advanced Usage

### Understanding the Classification Algorithm

The classifier uses a multi-factor approach to determine video categories:

1. **Detection Aggregation**: All YOLO detections above the confidence threshold are collected frame by frame
2. **Temporal Clustering**: Consecutive frames with the same species are grouped into clusters
3. **Transition Analysis**: The algorithm counts how often the detected species changes throughout the video
4. **Dominance Calculation**: Both total detection count and frame coverage are considered

### Classification Rules

A video is classified as a specific species only if:
- That species represents >70% of all detections
- Species transitions are below the threshold
- No predator-prey conflicts exist (e.g., wolf and deer in same video)

This conservative approach ensures high confidence in single-species classifications.

### Model Requirements

The YOLO model (best.pt) must be trained to detect the species defined in WlfCamData.yaml. The yaml file maps class IDs to species names:

```yaml
names:
  0: "WhiteTail"
  1: "MuleDeer"
  2: "Elk"
  3: "Moose"
  4: "Cougar"
  5: "Lynx"
  6: "Wolf"
  7: "Coyote"
  8: "Fox"
  9: "Bear"
```
Ideally, this list will expand in the future. Ity could hace already change, so refer the the actualy YAML file for updated pathing.

### About YOLO Model WolfVue_Beta1

this model is a very rough model that was scraped together with as much data as I could find;

Coyote: 65 instances
Elk: 236 instances
Moose: 40 instances
MuleDeer: 167 instances
WhiteTail: 60 instances
Wolf: 27 instances

this means its only actually able to identify 6 different species, is unbalanced, and highly skewed towards Elk because they make up so much of the dataset.

This is NOT a good model, but its a start. 

I cannot share the data, as its under NDA by the Gray Wolf Research Project, as some of it is on private property, so open weight is the best I can do. 

The goal of open sourcing this is to hopefully get some more trail cam videos that can be fine tuned for more species, more accurately, and maybe more efficiently.
If im being completely honest I hardly know what im doing, so someone who does know what theyre doing might be able to take this to the next level, and make a good model
that researchers and hobbiests may be able to utilize in the future.

you can find more details as to the results of this model training in its respective folder.

### About YOLO Model WolfVue_Beta_BroadV2

This (Idaho specific) model represents a significant step forward from the original WolfVue_Beta1, expanding from 6 species to 11 different wildlife species. The model was trained on 4,338 images containing 2,625 individual animal annotations across 50 epochs, achieving an mAP50 score of 0.673. In simple terms, this means the model correctly identifies and locates animals about 67% of the time when tested on completely new images it has never seen before.

The dataset follows a standard 70/20/10 split, meaning 70% of the data was used for training the model, 20% for validation during training, and the final 10% was held back exclusively for testing accuracy. This testing portion ensures we get an honest assessment of how well the model performs on truly unseen data.

While the species count has nearly doubled, the dataset still suffers from significant imbalance issues. WhiteTail deer dominate the dataset with 908 annotations representing over a third of all data, while species like Fox and Cougar have only 19 and 18 samples respectively. This creates a balance ratio of 50:1 between the most and least common species, which is far from ideal. The model will naturally be much better at identifying common species like WhiteTail, Elk, and Cow, while struggling with the rare species that lack sufficient training examples.

Despite these limitations, this model can now identify Elk, WhiteTail deer, MuleDeer, Coyote, Cow, Black Bear, Rabbit, Moose, Wolf, Fox, and Cougar. The 67% accuracy represents solid progress, mostly dragged down by the under-represented species, though there's clearly room for improvement, especially for the underrepresented species.

I still cannot share MOST of the raw data due to NDA restrictions with the Gray Wolf Research Project and private property considerations, so open weights remain the best contribution I can make. THis model does have a large portion of open data, largely annotated by me. I would estimate around 1500 ish annotations are made on free data I sourced from IDaho Fish and Game, so if youre interested in using these annotations, feel free to contatc me at natebluto@gmail.com. I would include them here, but adding images to this github repo is a nightmare. 

you can also find most of the public trail-camera data (non annotated) here:

### about YOLO model WolfVue_LimitedV2

This model is a more stable and accurate, but more limited model than WolfVue_Beta_BroadV2. Instead of having a large dataset with unbalanced trasining data, I focused on species that I had 100+ annotations with for stability. Each of the following species contained 133-250 annotations in the dataset across 6 common species, leading to a balanced model with little bias. 

Species in model:

WhiteTail
MuleDeer
Elk
Cow
Black Bear
Mule Deer
-------------------------------------------------------

During training, this model achieved a 97.14% mAP50 score (accuracy).

Doing some real world testing, I picked a trail camera from Idaho Fish and Game with unseen data at random.

Loc_205 (avalible at https://lila.science/datasets/idaho-camera-traps/), contained mostly Elk. Testing on this real world dataset;

it correctly identified 92.95% (488 out of 525) of all species in the "sorted" folder output. 
It correctly identified No_animal  97.91% of the time (329 out of 329)
It correctly sorted 90.93% (471 out of 518) of animals into the "Sorted" output folder

I believe for a folder containing mostly these common species, this model may actually be a viable automated solution with minimal human oversight. This model is a step in the right direction, and with time and more annotations, hopefully we can get similar results with 13 species or more.

Note: WolfVue automatically changes the thumbnail of the video to a point where an animal was detected. This makes it very easy to determine mistakes at a glance.

### note about tools

these tools are mostly self-explanatory and (somewhat) easy to understand/operate when you run them but sometimes they have a fewe quirks ill note here.

for the annotation tool, if youre analysing a new dataset, BE SURE that you load the correct yaml file or else it will say you have annotations of species you did not make e.g "395 Grizzly Bear annotations" because when you re-do the yaml you assign new number identifiers to the annotations, so you might get confusing resulkts if your yaml doesnt correspond to you balanced dataset.

### Performance Considerations

Processing speed depends on:
- Video resolution (higher resolution = slower)
- Model complexity (YOLOv8n is fastest, YOLOv8x is most accurate)
- Hardware (GPU acceleration dramatically improves speed)

For GPU acceleration, ensure you have CUDA-enabled PyTorch:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Batch Processing

The script automatically processes all videos in the input folder. For large datasets:
- The pre-scan estimates total processing time
- Progress bars show both per-video and overall progress
- A processing report is generated with detailed results

### Output Structure

Videos are organized into a taxonomy-based folder structure:

```
output_videos/
├── Sorted/
│   ├── Ungulates/
│   │   ├── WhiteTail/
│   │   ├── MuleDeer/
│   │   ├── Elk/
│   │   └── Moose/
│   └── Predators/
│       ├── Cougar/
│       ├── Lynx/
│       ├── Wolf/
│       ├── Coyote/
│       ├── Fox/
│       └── Bear/
├── Unsorted/
└── No_Animal/
```

### Customizing the Taxonomy

To modify the folder structure, edit the TAXONOMY dictionary in the script:

```python
TAXONOMY = {
    "Category": {
        "Species": ["Species"],
        # Add more as needed
    }
}
```

### Processing Report

After processing, check `processing_report.txt` for:
- Classification summary statistics
- Per-video classification details
- Detection rates and species percentages
- Reasoning for each classification decision

## Troubleshooting

**No videos found**: Ensure videos are in common formats (.mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv) and check both uppercase and lowercase extensions.

**Path errors**: The script uses relative paths from its location. Keep all folders (input_videos, output_videos, weights) in the same directory as the script.

**Memory issues**: For very long videos, consider splitting them or reducing resolution before processing.

**Slow processing**: Without GPU acceleration, expect approximately 10 frames per second on modern CPUs.

## Technical Details

### Frame-by-Frame Analysis

Each frame undergoes:
1. YOLO inference to detect bounding boxes
2. Confidence filtering
3. Species identification mapping
4. Temporal context integration

### Temporal Consistency

The algorithm maintains temporal consistency by:
- Tracking species across consecutive frames
- Identifying detection clusters
- Penalizing frequent species transitions
- Handling gaps in detections (animal temporarily out of frame)

### Edge Cases

The classifier handles several edge cases:
- Brief appearances by secondary species are ignored if under threshold
- Predator-prey scenarios always result in "Unsorted" classification
- Videos with sparse, intermittent detections are evaluated based on total pattern

### final remarks

I want to preface this by saying most of this was created with AI, the scripting, learning how to train models, etc. While I have a basic understanding of python, I would not have been
Able to achieve this without Claude, that said, developers will probably encounter some odd quirks in the code because of this, and I apologize in advance.

At first I was conflicted about using AI to code, but ultimately, the means that this is done does not matter so long as the end project benefits scientists. researchers, and hobbiests free of charge as intended.

Also note that I would like this project to be specifically for Trail cameras, so please make sure any data that is fine tuned is done with data FROM trail cameras. 

Thank you for reading, and possibly using this. I think this could make for a great open source project!

## What to improve on for the future

1. First and foremost, we need to improve the yolo model. Its pretty clear thats the main issue to be worked on.

I think focusing on large and common mammals from North America is important. I think we should catogorize things like birds broadly, as it would be a nightmare to try to identify 
each species, same with waterfowl. I think we should limit our scope to maybe 20 species at most for now if we get that many. We'll burn that bridge when we get to it i suppose. (also add more models which can be changed between within the program like a liberary)

2. Implement support for images.

Im already doing things frame by frame, this should be a no-brainer. It also should be incredibly easy. I just need to make the script recognize when images are input and sort those in the same way.

3. Add documentation for fine-tuning YOLO models

I will do this once ive re-learned how to do this myself

4. 
potentially underwater?

## Potential feature ideas

1. figure out how to do things like automating animal size and color calculations, determine if possible and how to implement.

2. Research a potential option for  image segmentation, might have to use a different model and make it an option, as it will be slower

## Training new models

VERY valuable resource for idaho trail cameras: https://lila.science/datasets/idaho-camera-traps/

## Contributing

When contributing, please maintain the existing code structure and add appropriate error handling for new features. The codebase prioritizes readability and maintainability over premature optimization.

 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
